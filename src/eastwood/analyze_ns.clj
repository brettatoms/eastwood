  :forms - a sequence of forms as read in, with any forms within a
      top-level do, or do forms nested within a top-level do,
      'flattened' to the top level themselves.  This sequence will
      include all forms in the file, as far as the file could be
      successfully read, even if an exception was thrown earlier than
      that during analysis or evaluation of the forms.

  :asts - a sequence of ASTs of the forms that were successfully
      analyzed without exception.  They correspond one-to-one with
      forms in the :forms sequence.

  :exception - nil if no exception occurred.  An Exception object if
      an exception was thrown during analysis, emit-form, or eval.

  If :exception is not nil, then the following keys will also be part
  of the returned map:

  :exception-phase - If an exception was thrown, this is a keyword
      indicating in what portion of analyze-file's operation this
      exception occurred.  Always :analyze+eval or :eval

  :exception-form - If an exception was thrown, the current form being
      processed when the exception occurred.

  Options:
  - :reader  a pushback reader to use to read the namespace forms
  - :opt     a map of analyzer options
    - `:abort-on-core-async-exceptions?` (default: falsey)
      - if true, analyze+eval exceptions stemming from `go` usage will abort execution.`
      - currently, execution is not aborted, rationale being https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/issues/395
    - :debug A set of keywords.
      - :all Enable all of the following debug messages.
      - :progress Print simple progress messages as analysis proceeds.
      - :ns Print all namespaces that exist according to (all-ns)
            before analysis begins, and then only when that set of
            namespaces changes after each form is analyzed.
      - :forms Print forms just before analysis, both before and after
               macroexpanding them.
      - :forms-pprint Pretty-print forms just before analysis, both
                      before and after macroexpanding them.
      - :ast Print complete ASTs just after analysis of each form.

  Returns a map of results of analyzing the namespace.  The map
  contains these keys:

  :analyze-results - The value associated with this key is itself a
      map with the following keys:
      :namespace - The source-nsym argument to this fn
      :source - A string containing the source read in from the

      :forms - See analyze-file docs for details
      :asts - See analyze-file
  :exception, :exception-phase, :exception-form - See analyze-file

  Options:
  - :reader  a pushback reader to use to read the namespace forms
  - :opt     a map of analyzer options
