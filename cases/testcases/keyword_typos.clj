;; Issue #163: George Simms pointed out that keywords that differ only
;; in the presence or absence of an initial '_' character are
;; reasonably common when interacting with Datomic.

;; The example below is completely made up. I have never worked with
;; Datomic before. It simply contains a pair of keywords that differ
;; only in presence/absence of a leading '_' character.
