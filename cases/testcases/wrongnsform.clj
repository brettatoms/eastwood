;; Clojure 1.6.0 throws exception for these requires with

;; Clojure 1.6.0 gives no exception for the following ns form, and
;; quietly ignores the (eastwood.foo) because it is a prefix with no
;; libspecs after it. It does not matter if what is inside the parens
;; is a valid namespace name or not. This _should_ be warned about by
;; Eastwood, since the author probably intended a bare symbol, or a
;; libspec in a vector, instead.

(ns testcases.nsform7

;; eastwood.util. There should be no warning for it.

;; Clojure 1.6.0 throws an exception during eval for this case, so no
;; warning from Eastwood will appear unless it is issued pre-eval.

;; java.lang.Exception: prefix cannot be nil, compiling(filename.clj:LINE:COL)

;; No such pre-eval Eastwood warnings are implemented for this, at

;; "java.lang.ClassCastExeption: clojure.lang.Symbol cannot be cast to clojure.lang.Keyword, compiling(filename.clj:LINE:COL)"

;; TBD: For Eastwood to give a clearer warning, it would either need
;; to do pattern matching on the exception thrown, perhaps including
;; the stack trace and form being eval'd when it was thrown, or check
;; the ns form after being read, and maybe also after being analyzed,
;; but before being eval'd. After analysis but before eval would
;; require modifying analyze+eval. After read but before analyze+eval
;; would miss non-top-level ns forms, but those are quite rare.

;; Clojure 1.6.0 with the :require below causes clojure.core/load-lib

;; option) with an odd number of arguments, it throws the exception:

;; IllegalArgumentException No value supplied for key: true

;; This makes sense upon seeing the value of options, but it is a very
;; confusing error message that does not help find the source of the
